Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Patek
In the Clearport like I Uber the jets
VVS's on me got my Gucci shirt wet
Put a M in my bag, I'ma get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S
Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down, where it ain't so
With checks in the streets, Jay number fours
Saint Laurent feet, put it on toes
Take it with me, double your dose
Covered with angels that's watching my soul
Jet got a bed, it's bigger windows
Said I'll be there in 10, but I got there in four
I feel like I'm chosen, I'm covered in gold
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
I left her wide open, no self control
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Took nothing but five minutes, she hopped in and drove
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mm
Ice on my neck, flawless baguettes
Hop off a jet, barely get rest
Cash through the month, I get a check
Yves Saint Laurent on my pants and my chest
Chanel, her dress, clean up her mess
I eat her flesh, you know the rest
Count up a hun', cop a Rolex
Shine like the sun, you truly blessed
Two-tone Pateks
In the Clearport like I Uber the jets
VVS's on me got my Louis shirt wet
It's a M in my bag and get used to these racks
I went to school where they teach you finesse
Five hundred shoes for the drip I invest
I'm the boss man, I keep cash in the desk
Know the coupe fast when it end with a S
La Flame on a island
Me and Cash, Gunna hopped on a Learjet
Got Prada's, every color
And I got CC's you ain't seen yet
Said I'd kick the cup and now I'm asking, "where the codeine at"?
30 pointers and up, Eliantte drippin', my whole team wet
